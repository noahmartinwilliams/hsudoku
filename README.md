# sudoku
This is a simple sudoku game (which currently starts off with an empty board) which was meant for learning Haskell's state monad.
The game is played entirely in the terminal. The controls for it are simple: for every turn just type in "n,m,v" where n and m are numbers between zero and nine to indicate coordinates, and v is the value to set that position on the board to.
